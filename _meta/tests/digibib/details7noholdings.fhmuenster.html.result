Skin sensitisation refers to an allergic response following skin contact with the tested\n chemical, as defined by the United Nations Globally Harmonized System \nof Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (UN GHS). This Test Guideline (TG) provides an in vitro procedure (the human cell Line Activation Test h-CLAT method) used for supporting the discrimination between skin sensitisers and non-sensitisers in\n accordance with the UN GHS. The h-CLAT method is proposed to address \nthe third key event of the skin sensitisation AOP by quantifying changes\n in the expression of cell surface markers \nassociated with the process of activation of monocytes and dendritic \ncells (DC) (i.e. CD86 and CD54), in the human monocytic leukaemia cell line THP-1, following exposure to sensitising test\n chemical. These surface molecules are typical markers of monocytic \nTHP-1 activation and may mimic DC activation, which plays a critical \nrole in T-cell priming. The changes of surface \nmarker expression are measured by flow cytometry following cell staining\n with fluorochrome-tagged antibodies. The relative fluorescence intensity of surface markers compared to solvent/vehicle control are calculated and used in the prediction model, to support the discrimination between sensitisers and non-sensitisers."}, "home-url": null}
